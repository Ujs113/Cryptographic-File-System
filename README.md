# Cryptographic-File-System

This is a simple implementation of a **Cryptographic File System(CFS)** done as part of my academic project for the Operating Systems Laboratory.


## Project Specifications:
- Supports CRUD operations on any File type
- Encrypt and Decrypt Files of any File type(i.e `Text`/`Image`/etc.)
- Random Encryption Key generation for secured File storage
- Encryption Technique Used: `Caesar Cipher`

## Requirements:
- C++ compiler that supports C++17 & above (i.e `GNU C++ Compiler`, etc.)

## Steps to Run this Project:
- Assuming GNU C++ compiler is installed
- Run the following commands:
- To Compile --> `g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp`
- To Execute --> For windows: `.\a.exe` (or) For Linux: `./a.out`
